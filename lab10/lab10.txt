a) One of the biggest differences is the fact that Mongo use documents instead of tables/rows,
documents can be inserted into a database using a command line while SQL to my knowledge doesn't
allow this operation outside of its own scripting tool, and even if it does the CRUD operations for
SQL are a lot longer and more specified than the simple .js style of insertion. They both, however, store data
in an item format and allow for the editing and updating of this data.

b) Allowing for local editing of the database makes it very accessible, however, this easy access could make it very
dangerous if someone is using the data at the same time that someone is updating it in a different location.
This can create data consistency issues in theory but in practice it seems pretty good so far.

c) You could should probably not use it in production because sandbox, by nature allows for all operations on a database,
a freedom that could be potentially problematic for an active database. However, in theory this database is no different than any
other and could store data as necessary with relatively little to no problem.
