a)Development allows for quick and easy manipulation of files and projects without going through the process
of checking rechecking and pushing new information. You do have to do more overhead during testing, making sure commands
and connections are made properly, but it is very efficient.
Production maximizes web efficiency it allows for the quick and easy compilation and projection of the projects files
in one complete and deliverable package.

b) Production uses auto-prefixer, which makes your CSS compatible with any browser it also
tells web-pack that you are running production which optimizes the application (Uglify).
You can search the source files from the browser and the console will display that you are now working in production

c) It is a lot easier, especially if the application isn't getting much traffic, it is simple to deploy and
allows for easy connection to all outlets including git and mongo.

d) It uses the npm start and install scripts from the package.json file and you can see the application build in the console output
