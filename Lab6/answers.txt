1. For some reason Chrome's Dev Tools only allowed me to test the GET method because the REST method
defaults to GET every-time you go to the page unless you call the other methods with a button push. With
curl the default isn't set to anything so you can test the functions POST, PUT, DELETE becuase what is run
is called from the command line and so it by passes any default systems. The GET method, however, doesn't
return anything.

Commands:
      - $ curl -X POST localhost:3000/request -d '{"arg":"Hello"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
      - $ curl -X PUT localhost:3000/request -d '{"arg":"Hi"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
      - $ curl -X DELETE localhost:3000/request -d '{"arg":"Hello"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

2. 404, or "Not Found."
