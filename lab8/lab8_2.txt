1)
  a) A tree of components, a component structure, makes the UI com-posable,
    React is extremely dependent on com-posable components.

  b) JSX works on Javascript similarly to how XML works for HTML in that XML
    is a lot simpler to read and comprehend.

  c) React is safer because it is protect by XXS as a default and doesn't produce the HTML
    String

  d)The comment first loads by making the comment box, which stores/hold the data objects
    with a specified data "type", then the comment is pulled from the server and saved by the function
    inside of the comment box. It passed to the browser where the box is rendered.

  e) Props can be used to read or write data from/to the box/rendered markup. The state state setting the component's
    data type. When it is updated the component re-renders itself.

2)
  a) When I do a delete on a section of the list then the page immediately updates/reloads so that the changes are
    reflected in the page. This is because react checks for changes every time the page is reloaded or refreshed.
    However, if I delete author and text but leave the object id an error is thrown because there is no child to display.

  b) Because it should only show up if there is something to display, aka a comment is available to be displayed.

  c) The user always receives the current up to date data and the difference in data doesn't cause confusion because
    the different data is not stored in the same location.

  d) Optimism is generally used to better user experience because the server can malfunction for various reasons, creating the risk.
